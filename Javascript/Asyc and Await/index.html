    <h3>
        In JavaScript, async and await are keywords that work together to simplify asynchronous programming and make it
        look more like synchronous code. They were introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) and provide a more readable and
        concise way to work with Promises.
    </h3>

    <h3>
        The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. An asynchronous function always returns a Promise,
        and the async keyword ensures that the function's return value is wrapped in a Promise automatically. It allows
        the use of the await keyword inside the function to pause execution until a Promise is fulfilled or rejected.
    </h3>

    <p>
        In this example, the fetchData() function is defined as an asynchronous function using the async keyword. Inside
        the function, we use the await keyword to pause execution until the Promise returned by fetch() resolves with a
        response. We then use await again to pause execution until the Promise returned by response.json() resolves with
        the parsed JSON data.
        <br><br>
        Using async/await makes the code look sequential and easier to read, as if it were synchronous code. The await
        keyword eliminates the need for explicit Promise chaining with multiple then() calls.
        <br><br>
        The try/catch block is used to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the Promises. If any
        Promise within the async function rejects, the control flow jumps to the catch block, allowing you to handle the
        error gracefully.
        <br><br>
        It's important to note that await can only be used inside an asynchronous function marked with the async
        keyword. It provides a convenient way to work with Promises and handle their results in a more synchronous-like
        manner, enhancing the readability and maintainability of asynchronous code.

        async function fetchData() {
            try {
              const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
              const data = await response.json();
              console.log(data);
            } catch (error) {
              console.log('Error:', error);
            } 
          } 
          fetchData();
