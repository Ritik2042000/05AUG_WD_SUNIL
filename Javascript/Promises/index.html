    <h2>In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous
        operation and its resulting value. It is used to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and readable
        manner, avoiding the "callback hell" problem.
        rejection.</h2>

    <h3>
        A Promise can be in one of three states:
            <br><br>
        Pending: The initial state. The Promise is still undergoing the asynchronous operation and has not yet been
        fulfilled or rejected. <br><br>
        Fulfilled: The asynchronous operation completed successfully, and the Promise is fulfilled. It contains the
        resulting value. <br><br>
        Rejected: The asynchronous operation encountered an error or failure, and the Promise is rejected. It contains
        the reason for the rejection. <br><br>
    </h3>
    Promises provide a way to handle the result of an asynchronous operation using the then() method. The then()
    method takes two callback functions as arguments: one for the fulfillment of the Promise and another for the

       const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Perform an asynchronous operation
  const result = doSomethingAsynchronous();

  if (result) {
    resolve(result); // Fulfill the Promise
  } else {
    reject('Error'); // Reject the Promise
  }
});

  .then((fulfilledValue) => {
    console.log('Promise fulfilled:', fulfilledValue);
  })
  .catch((rejectionReason) => {
    console.log('Promise rejected:', rejectionReason);
  });
